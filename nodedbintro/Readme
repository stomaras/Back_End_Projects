What is Sequalize?

An Object Relational Mapping Library
it does all the heavy lifting, all the SQL code behind the scenes for us 
and maps into js objects which we can call to execute that behind the scenes

User

name
age
email

const user = User.create({name:'Max', age:28, password:'dsdsdf'})

Models ---------------> User.Product

Associations -----------------------> User.hasMany(Product)
