Iterating over a database result set: When fetching data from a database, the iterator pattern can be used to iterate over the result set, providing a standarized way to access and process each row of data.

# Terminologies

1. Iterator: An interface or an abstract base class that defines the operations for accessing and traversing elements in the container.
It typically includes methods like next(), hasNext(), reset() etc. The Iterator provides a common way to iterate over the elements regardless of the specific container type.

2. ConcreteIterator: It's a concrete implementation of the Iterator interface or class. The ConcreteIterator provides the actual implementation for traversing the elements of a particular container. It keeps track of the current position within the container
and provides the necessary methods to move to the next element, check for the existence of the next element, and retrieve the current element.

3. Aggregate: It represents the container object that holds a collection of elements. The Aggregate provides a method, usually called 
createIterator(), that returns an Iterator object for traversing the elements. The Aggregate may also define other methods to manipulate the collection of elements, such as adding or removing elements.

4. ConcreteAggregate: It's a concrete implementation of the Aggregate interface or class. The ConcreteAggregate defines the specific container object and its structure. It creates an appropriate ConcreteIterator object and returns it to the client through the createIterator() method.
