# Things to Note

# Define abstract interfaces: Create abstract interfaces (often using abstract base classes or ABCs in Python) for the products 
# and factories. These interfaces should declare the methods that the concrete product and factory classes must implement.

# Implement concrete product classes: Create concrete classes that implement the abstract product interfaces. Each concrete product
# represents a specific implementation or variant of a product.

# Implement concrete factory classes: Create concrete classes that implement the abstract factory interface. Each concrete factory
# is responsible for creating a family of related products. It provides the implementation for the factory methods that create the
# concrete product objects.

# Use dependency injection: The Client code should not directly instantiate the concrete product or factory classes.Instead, it should 
# depend on the abstract interfaces and receive a concrete factory instance either through dependency injection. This allows for 
# flexibility and easier testing.

# Consider using a registry or configuration file: If you have a large number of concrete factories or products, you may consider using 
# registry or a configuration file to map the concrete factories to their corresponding product implementations.This can make it easier
# to dynamically create the appropriate concrete factories based on runtime conditions or configuration settings.
