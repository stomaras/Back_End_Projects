# Real World Cases:

# Document Processors:
In a document processing application, a visitor pattern can be used to implement various operations such as spell checking, word count, formatting, and generating statistics. Each visitor represents a specific operation performed on the document elements like paragraphs, headings, images e.t.c

# Database Query Optimization: 
When optimizing database queries, a visitor pattern can be used to traverse the query execution plan and perform various optimizations
or statistical analyses on each step of the plan.

# Financial Calculations: 
In financial applications, the visitor pattern can be employed to perform calculations on different financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, options etc. Each visitor can represent a specific financial calculation, such as portfolio valuation, risk analysis, or performance measurement.

# Terminologies

- Visitor: This is an interface that defines the visit methods to each element type in the object structure. Each visit method represents a specific operation to be performed on the elements. Concrete visitor classes implement these visit methods to provide
the actual implementation of the operations.

- ConcreteVisitor: These are the concrete implementations of the Visitor interface or abstract class. Each ConcreteVisitor class implements the visit methods declared in the Visitor interface for specific element types. They define how the operations are perfromed 
on the elements.

- Element: This is an interface or an abstract class that defines the accept method. The accept method takes a visitor object as a parameter and allows the visitor to access the internal state of the element. Each concrete element class implements the accept method,
enabling the visitor to visit and perform operations on the element.

- ConcreteElement: These are the concrete implementations of the Element interface or abstract class. Each ConcreteElement class implements the accept method and provides access to the internal state of the element. It allows the visitor to visit and operate on the specific element.
